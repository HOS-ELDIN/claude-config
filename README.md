# Claude Configuration & Session Management

A comprehensive configuration system for Claude that automatically sets up environment awareness, development workflows, and session management capabilities.

## 🚀 Quick Start for Claude

When starting Claude in a new project:
1. User provides this repository URL: `https://github.com/[username]/claude-config`
2. Claude automatically fetches and implements all configurations
3. No manual setup or explanations needed from the user

## 🤖 What Claude Will Do Automatically

When given this repository URL, Claude will:

1. **Read all configuration files** from the repository
2. **Implement the CLAUDE.md instructions** as global memory
3. **Set up session management** commands in the current project
4. **Apply WSL development workflows** if on WSL
5. **Create necessary directories** (commands/, sessions/)
6. **Copy configuration to ~/.claude/** for persistence
7. **Enable all session tracking functionality**

### Automatic Actions Performed

```bash
# Claude will execute these automatically:
mkdir -p ~/.claude
mkdir -p commands sessions
touch sessions/.current-session
cp CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
# Copy all command files to project
# Set up session management system
```

## 📝 Session Management Commands

Claude will make these commands available:

### 1. Start a Session
```
/project:session-start [optional-name]
```
- Creates timestamped session file
- Initializes tracking with goals
- Records starting git status

### 2. Update Progress
```
/project:session-update [optional-notes]
```
- Adds timestamped updates
- Tracks git changes and todo status
- Documents ongoing work

### 3. End Session
```
/project:session-end
```
- Generates comprehensive summary
- Documents all changes
- Clears active session

## 🎯 User Workflow

1. **User**: Creates or opens a project
2. **User**: Starts Claude
3. **User**: Says "Read https://github.com/[username]/claude-config"
4. **Claude**: Fetches repo and implements everything
5. **Result**: Fully configured Claude with session management

## 📋 What Gets Configured

✅ **Environment Setup**
- WSL awareness and optimizations
- Project directory structure
- Performance configurations

✅ **Development Workflow**
- Always work in `~/projects/`
- Never develop in `/mnt/` paths
- Git operations in WSL

✅ **Session Management**
- Track development progress
- Document decisions and changes
- Maintain context between sessions

✅ **Auto-sync Rules**
- Keep global and repo configs in sync
- Commit and push configuration updates
- Maintain consistency across devices

## 🚦 For Claude: Implementation Steps

When reading this repository, Claude should:

1. **Fetch and read all files** in the repository
2. **Create local directories**: `commands/` and `sessions/`
3. **Copy command files** from repo to local `commands/`
4. **Create session tracker**: `sessions/.current-session`
5. **Update global config**: Copy CLAUDE.md to `~/.claude/`
6. **Apply all instructions** from CLAUDE.md immediately
7. **Confirm setup completion** to the user

## 📚 Additional Notes

- Sessions are stored as markdown files with timestamps
- Configuration changes auto-sync between global and repo
- All paths assume WSL Linux environment
- Commands use Claude's `/project:` prefix

## 🤝 Maintenance

To update configurations:
1. Edit files in this repository
2. Commit changes
3. Push to remote
4. Claude will sync on next initialization
